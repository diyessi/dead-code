# dead-code
Sources (and some binaries) recovered from dumps of old tapes. Errors in the tape dumps are corrected and tape dumps are split into files, one file per deck. Binary decks remain binary, while character decks are converted to the closest equivalent UTF-8 (some old glyphs are not in Unicode).
